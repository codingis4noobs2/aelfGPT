## Setup and Deployment (Local)

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork** this repository on GitHub to your own account.
2. **Clone** your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aelfgpt.git
   cd aelfgpt
   ```

### 2. Create and Configure the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project using the provided example:

1. **Copy** the example `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Fill in** the environment variables:

   - **MONGODB_CONN_URI**: Your MongoDB connection URI.
   - **EDEN_AI_API_KEY**: Your Eden AI API key. Obtain it from [Eden AI](https://app.edenai.run/bricks/default).
   - **AI_ML_API_KEY**: Your GPT-4 API key from [AIML API](https://aimlapi.com/app/keys).
   - **GOOGLE_API_KEY**: Your Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat).

### 3. Set Up Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create Embeddings and Configure MongoDB Atlas

1. **Run** the Jupyter notebook provided to create and store embeddings into MongoDB.

2. **Configure MongoDB Atlas**:

   - **Create a Vector Search**:
     - Go to MongoDB Atlas and navigate to the search section.
     - Create a new vector search with the provided JSON configuration:

       ```json
       {
         "fields": [
           {
             "numDimensions": 1536,
             "path": "embedding",
             "similarity": "cosine",
             "type": "vector"
           }
         ]
       }
       ```

   - **Create Atlas Search**:
     - Select the `docs` collection and create an Atlas Search.
     - This process may take 1-2 minutes. Once done, your vector search should have status 'Active' and its ready for use.

### 5. Run the Application Locally

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

## Deployment Guide for Streamlit Application

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy your Streamlit application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Cloud Run. 

### Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud Account**: If you don't have a Google Cloud account, create one [here](https://cloud.google.com/).

### Getting Started

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Sign in to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Enable the billing account (free trial recommended to avoid unintended costs).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codingis4noobs2/aelfGPT.git
   cd aelfGPT
   ```

3. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

4. **Initialize Your Project**:
   ```bash
   gcloud init
   ```

### Cloud Run Deployment

#### Create Required Files

1. **Dockerfile**:
   Create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:
   ```dockerfile
   # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
   FROM python:3.10-slim

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the requirements file into the container
   COPY requirements.txt /app/

   # Install the required dependencies
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Copy the rest of the application code into the container
   COPY . /app

   # Expose the port that the app runs on
   EXPOSE 80

   # Command to run the app
   CMD ["streamlit", "run", "Home.py", "--server.enableCORS", "false", "--browser.serverAddress", "0.0.0.0", "--browser.gatherUsageStats", "false", "--server.port", "80"]
   ```

2. **app.yaml**:
   Create an `app.yaml` file with the following content:
   ```yaml
   runtime: python310

   entrypoint: streamlit run Home.py --server.enableCORS false --browser.serverAddress 0.0.0.0 --browser.gatherUsageStats false --server.port $PORT
   ```

#### Build and Deploy

1. **Build the Container**:
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/streamlit-app
   ```
   Replace `PROJECT-ID` with your actual project ID, which can be found in the top left dropdown in the Google Cloud Console.

2. **Deploy the Container**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/streamlit-app --platform managed --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

#### Note
If you encounter the error `Cloud Run â€“ Failed to start and then listen on the port defined by the PORT`:

1. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t {project-name} .
   ```
2. Then, redeploy the container.

### Alternative Deployment Method: Cloud Run UI

You can also deploy the container via the Cloud Run UI in the Google Cloud Console:
1. Navigate to Cloud Run
2. Click on create "+ Create Service" Button.
3. In the Cloud Run UI, select the latest container image and enter a service name for the application.

4. Click on the radio button "Allow unauthenticated invocations" so that others can visit your app.
5. Select the appropriate machine configuration based on your estimated traffic handling and click "Create."

You will receive a link to your application in a few minutes.
